### Andrew Park (PI)

"I am a professor who develops theory to explain and predict population and evolutionary biology of host-parasite interactions" [CV](resources/parkCVmay2021.pdf) 



### David Vasquez

"I am a PhD student in Ecology and a trainee in the IDEAS program researching how ecological and environmental conditions can affect the abundance and geographic range of parasites"


### Annakate Schatz

![](images/annakate.jpg){width=50mm}

"I am broadly interested in spatial modeling, model evaluation, and species’ range dynamics. For my PhD research, I am investigating how hosts’ parasite communities change between native and non-native ranges, across terrestrial mammals."



### Daniel Suh

"Hi. I am a PhD student and a trainee in the IDEAS program. In my PhD research I use mathematical modeling and empirical data to explain and predict how and when changes in host community composition can affect the transmission of parasites."


### TJ Odom

"I'm a PhD student and IDEAS trainee interested in how climate change may affect host-parasite interactions. I study this by researching the impacts of climate tracking host species on the interactions with their parasites."
